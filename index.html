      <p>At a young age I had the experience of a lifetime living overseas. This time in my life instilled in me a lust for knowledge. I loved learning about the new cultures and languages of anywhere I visited. Now that I'm older I have turned that love of learning towards my work as a JavaScript developer. I enjoy using Test Driven Development to write clean, well-organized code. When I'm not working on a project or playing with some new framework you can find me out relaxing in my hammock or hiking with my dog!</p>
